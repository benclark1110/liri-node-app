    2. Search any upcoming concert details via bands in town api - node liri.js concert-this {band name here}
    3. Search any movie details via the omdb api - node liri.js movie-this {movie name here}
    4. Same functionality as number 1 but reads song name from the random.txt file - node liri.js spotify-this-song
